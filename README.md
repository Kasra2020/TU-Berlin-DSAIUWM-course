# TU-Berlin-DSAIUWM-course
This repository serves only as the supportive material for the lecture entitled "Deep Learning Architectures - Theory and Applications", given at TU Berlin on July 2nd, 2024. The lecture is part of a lecture series "Data Science and Artificial Intelligence for Urban Water Management" organized by the Smart Water Networks department of TU Berlin.

The ResNets are implemented based on the paper "He, K., Zhang, X., Ren, S., & Sun, J. (2016). Deep residual learning for image recognition. In Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (pp. 770-778)". The dataset utilized in this course is CIFAR-10, sourced from "Krizhevsky, A., & Hinton, G. (2009). Learning multiple layers of features from tiny images".
